        <h3>Chelsea Market</h3>
        <p>You could find almost any kind of food that you want here, from Mexican to Mediterranean to Italian ice cream! It's a little bazaar-like area with plenty of restaurants to choose from.</p>

        <h3>Juliana's/Grimaldi's Pizza</h3>
        <p>You've probably heard of New York's legendary pizza, but have you tasted it? If not (or even if you have), this should be your first stop! These two pizza parlors are right next each other. The story goes that Grimaldi's was very famous, but then changed its dough recipe. The main chef wasn't too hapy about it, so he branched off and formed Juliana's which sticks to the original recipe. Which is better? You decide! Just beware, there might be some pretty long lines!</p>

        <h3>Smorgasburg</h3>
        <p>Smorgasburg is, as its name suggests, a smorgasbord of food trucks, tents, and small vendors offering all sorts of meals and treats. During the summer they hang out at Prospect Park, while they move indoors at Atlantic Center during the winter. Usually they set up shop right next to Brooklyn Flea, considered by many to be a "must-see" in Brooklyn.</p>

        <h3>F. Ottomanelli Burgers</h3>
        <p>This joint in Queens is touted as "the best hamburger in New York City", and I can attest that this place really does live up to the hype! It originated when one of the Ottomanellis, a famous family of butchers in New York, had the idea to make a quality hamburger. They use the finest ingredients to craft their menu, including H&auml;agen-Dazs ice cream in their milk shakes!</p>

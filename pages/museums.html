        <h3>9/11 Museum</h3>
        <p>The 9/11 museum is one of the most fascinating museums I have ever been to. I thought I would only spend a few hours here, but my siblings got mad that I wouldn't leave after 6+! The museum has lots of artifacts from 9/11 and tells the
          whole story of the events of that day with videos, audio from the planes, and written accounts. You truly get a sense for the individual and collective spirit of New Yorkers and Americans as a whole, the sacrifices of the first responders,
          and how the events of that day shaped the world for decades to come.</p>

        <h3>MoMA</h3>
        <p>The MoMA has tons of art! They have permanent galleries featuring Matisse, Cubism, and my personal favorite, Monet's <cite>Water Lilies</cite>. They also have a few rotating exhibitions, so you can see new pieces every time you go!</p>

        <h3>The Guggenheim</h3>
        <p>The Guggenheim is a bit smaller than the other art museums and a bit more quirky, but fun nonetheless! You start at the bottom and work your way up a pedestrian spiral, looking at artwork on the walls along the way. They have some pieces
          by one of my favorite artists, Paul C&eacute;zanne.</p>

        <h3>The Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island</h3>
        <p>The Statue of Liberty is obviously among the most well-recognized landmarks of New York, welocming immigrants as they arrived to their new home. Ellis Island is right next door, and has an awesome museum about the time period when most
          immigrants still came to the US by boat. Both of these are worth a visit!</p>

        <h3>New York Transit Museum</h3>
        <p>If, after riding the subway around all day, you're curious as to how that got built, then the Transit museum is for you! It explains a lot about the dangerous conditions that early immigrants worked under in order to get the subway that
          we know today up and running. You can climb in models of old New York City subway cars and buses (as you see me doing in the photo). Their souvenir shop also sells some dope NYC subway socks! </p>
